📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Retail Sales Intelligence Dashboard developed during my Data Analytics Internship at Elevvo. The solution transforms raw retail transaction data into an interactive, decision-oriented analytics experience.

Rather than focusing only on static reporting, the dashboard emphasizes executive monitoring, product performance evaluation, and regional intelligence to support data-driven retail strategy.

The analysis highlights how revenue growth, discount behavior, product mix, and regional concentration collectively influence overall business performance.
